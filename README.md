# Ubuntu Environment Setup for Mudrekh 

While I know some things in this repo are specific for me, feel free to
manage/update/change what you want to suit your needs. These are just
things/programs/tools/styles I use often in my day to day work.

Special thanks to [Luis Lobo](https://github.com/luislobo) for the
