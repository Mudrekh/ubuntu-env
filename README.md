# Ubuntu Environment Setup for Mudrekh 

While I know somethings in this repo
are specific for me, feel free to manage/update/change what you want to suit
you needs. Thes are just things/programs/tools/styles I use often in my day to
day work.

Special thanks to [Luis Lobo](https://github.com/luislobo) for the
